# Experiment Proposal: Nunchi-Driven Churn Intervention

## 1. Test Objective (The Core Hypothesis)
**Hypothesis:** An emotionally resonant, purpose-driven intervention (Variant B) based on a drop in the `aura_harmony_index` ($\mathbf{N}$) will result in higher Long-Term Value (LTV) and lower churn than a simple price discount (Variant A).

## 2. Target Audience
Users whose `aura_harmony_index` (AHI) drops below **50.0** for 72 consecutive hours. This is our uniquely defined "Seeking Resonance" (High Churn Risk) segment.

## 3. Experiment Variants

| Variant | Intervention | Revenue Goal | Core Lattice Principle |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A (Control)** | Display a standard **"20% Off"** win-back discount offer upon app open. | Test price elasticity. | Standard Business Practice |
| **B (Nunchi Intervention)** | Offer a free, temporary 24-hour upgrade to the **Jeong Resonator Tier** and a custom message: **"Your Aura Seeks Harmony. Reconnect and Restore Your Focus."** | Test the power of emotional value and free trial access to premium features. | Nunchi $\mathbf{N}$ and Jeong $\mathbf{J}$ |

## 4. Success Metrics
* **Primary Metric:** **7-Day Retention Rate** (The true measure of churn prevention).
* **Secondary Metric:** **Upgrade Conversion** to any paid tier (Proving the value of the free trial).
