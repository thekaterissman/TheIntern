# TheInter# The Intern App: A Core Lattice for Hyper-Efficient Revenue Growth (Shipaton 2025)

## üöÄ Concept: Nunchi-Driven Efficiency
This project, named the "Intern App" for its extreme focus on efficiency and low overhead, is a **Productivity Timer** deployed as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Its true innovation lies not in its function, but in its use of the **Core Lattice**‚Äîa sophisticated data architecture based on ancient Korean precepts‚Äîto achieve superior monetization and retention.

## üîë The Core Lattice: Data-Driven Metaphysics
The application passes three unique, real-time user properties to RevenueCat, allowing for an entirely new generation of A/B testing:

| Precept | Metric Name | Revenue Function |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Jeong** (Deep Connection) | `user_loyalty_score` | **Subscription Revenue:** Triggers offers to upgrade to the **Han Contributor License**. |
| **Nunchi** (Ambient Harmony) | `aura_harmony_index` (AHI) | **Churn Prevention:** The leading indicator for emotional churn, triggering targeted intervention. |
| **Han** (Purpose/Resilience) | `lifetime_resilience_points` | **Non-Recurring Revenue (NRR):** Prerequisite for the high-margin **Proof of Resilience Certificate** IAP. |

## üí° Monetization Model: Metaphysical Pricing
We use a **Metaphysical Pricing** strategy to maximize ARPU and LTV:
1.  **Free Tier (The Seeker):** Access to the basic Timer.
2.  **Paid Tier 1 (The Resonator):** Standard subscription, unlocks basic Jeong logging.
3.  **Paid Tier 2 (The Han Contributor License):** Premium subscription required for **Han Ledger** contribution‚Äîmonetizing user purpose and resilience.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Foundation
* **Architecture:** Single-container Docker deployment (Python/Flask/Gunicorn) for maximum Nunchi Stability.
* **Deployment:** CI/CD pipeline ensures rapid iteration and a perfect score for the #BuildInPublic Award.
